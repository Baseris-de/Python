Rock-paper-scissors is a hand game that is played by two people. 
The players count to three in unison and simultaneously "throw‚Äù one of three hand signals 
that correspond to rock, paper or scissors. The winner is determined by the rules:
Rock smashes scissors
Scissors cuts paper
Paper covers rock
Rock-paper-scissors is a surprisingly popular game that many people play seriously 
(see the Wikipedia article for details). 

Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock (RPSLS) is a variant of Rock-paper-scissors that allows five choices. 
Each choice wins against two other choices, loses against two other choices and ties against itself.

the game.
